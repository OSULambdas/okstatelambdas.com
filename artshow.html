										<h2>"Family Dinner" - Jamil Matin</h2> <br>
										<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hi, my name is Jamil Matin and I'm currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. Originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh, my family and I moved to America when I was in the 3rd grade. One of the most important traditions that we've carried with us is gathering around a large dish and eating together. Even to this day, we continue to spend important days like holidays and birthdays with my family in this way. For me, it's a source of warmth and happiness, and a tradition I hope to continue with my friends and family in the future. The theme "Warmest Memory" relates to this picture because it shows times where I felt the happiest surrounded by my family and eating good food and it is a tradition I hope to continue with my friends and family in the future!</p>

										<h2>"Morning View" - Annika Kerns</h2> <br>
										<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">My name is Annika. I’m a sophomore chemistry major from Muskogee, Oklahoma. Since I was younger, my goal has been to make it out of my city and live my own dream. My warmest memory embodies just that. It was the first morning waking up in my first apartment. I had spent all summer refurbishing all my furniture to my personalize my own new home. Indulging in the stillness of the early morning after a chaotic day of moving prior. I felt so accomplished to sit on my OWN couch in my OWN apartment drinking a cup of coffee. That is exactly what I painted.</p>

										<h2>"Shadows of the West" - Vanessa Barrios-Perez</h2> <br>
										<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I wanted to create a special gift for my friend's birthday, and after much consideration, I decided to paint a portrait of a western woman that my friend very much admired. From early morning until afternoon, I worked on the painting, spending time on every detail, every line, and every shadow. I wanted to create a beautiful piece that would capture the essence of the woman and be a cherished gift for my friend.
										To achieve the level of detail I desired, I used a nail art brush for the shadows because of how small and intricate they were, creating depth and dimension in the portrait. I invested all my emotions and efforts into the painting, focusing on even the smallest nuances to bring the portrait to life.
										It was a meaningful and purposeful gift, showing my friend how much I valued our friendship and how important they were to me. This experience became my warmest memory because I had spent so much time and energy on this project. It was a chance to show my friend how much I cared for them and how much their friendship meant to me. The joy and appreciation they expressed made it all worth it, and I knew that this gift would hold a special place in their heart for years to come.</p>

										<h2>"Freedom of Creativity" - Kong Pheng Her</h2> <br>
										<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I was born in Thailand but raised in America. I spent most of my life in Alaska but I used to live in California beforehand. I loved drawing as a kid and the more I grew, the more I wanted to improve as an artist. That is why I chose to major in Art. I am a Junior, studying at Oklahoma State University. To me, “warmest memory”, means a memory that makes me feel safe, free, and comfortable. Looking back, I felt most comfortable when I used to draw for fun as a kid. No limitation, no physics, or anatomy. Everything I drew was pure imagination and creativity. Today, I find it hard to do that because of school, my knowledge of art, and the community that I am in. That is why I made this piece to resembling, me as a kid having the “Freedom of Creativity”. This piece also resembles how I improved as an artist. I resemble the levels I went through to reach the level that I am in today. I used to draw sharks, animals, Spider-Man, dragons, etc. Today I still draw those things, but much better, and now I also have many original characters. These original characters reflect me in a way and sometimes they reflect the people around me. I am proud to be an artist despite the struggles, constant  artist blocks, etc. To me, art is a language in which I can use to express things I cannot say out loud. That is the reason why art is my warmest memory.</p>

										<h2>“My warmest memories” - Mya Cerda </h2> <br>
										<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Throughout my life my grandpa has been the source of my greatest memories. When trying to think of an idea for this project, he is the only thing my mind went to. This is a heartfelt collage of a few of our memories growing up. I’m a sophomore majoring in Marketing. I’m from Moore, Oklahoma. The theme “warmest memory” to me is a person. </p>

										<h2>"Summer Morning" - Sierra Do</h2> <br>
										<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sierra Do is a Chinese American from Tulsa, Oklahoma. She likes to creates the things she wants to see in the real world through design and illustration. Sierra also enjoys collecting Pokémon cards and listening to new music. When Sierra is not designing you can find her playing a video game. In the future, she hopes to be able to create an impact on people through graphic design and creativity. 

										For Sierra the theme "warmest memory" represents the small reoccurrences that happen within her daily life. Which is why the scene that she depicted is something that she would like to relive when she is able to visit home. The work is made to represent what a morning day feels like for me at home. This piece depicts what it is like for me when I wake up in the morning. As my room is really dark even during the day, but I can still see some beams of light come into my room showing that there is daylight. During the mornings, I can also typically figure out what we eat that day all from the comfort of my bed. I can base it all on the smells that waft into my room from my mom's cooking. The smells are always different each day as she can cook a range of Chinese and Vietnamese foods.</p>

I think it was the first moment I saw her truly breathe and relax.I am a SCED: English and Spanish major in my 4th year at OSU. I interpreted "warmest memory" as a moment in time where I felt the most at peace. </p>
